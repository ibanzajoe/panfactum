## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## James Annoyances
- unable to utilize path alias for importing css files
- unable to utilize generated shadcn components when there are context provider requirements
- some typescript conflict between old website that causes typescript errors on react elements that are not actually there. 
  (verified by removing old website from pnpm-workspace)

## Questions

### Is there a client initialization lifecycle hook area in astro? 
Goal is to compute some state before anything else loads. 

#### Middleware
https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/ but requires we run in SSR mode
